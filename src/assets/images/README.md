# Studio Images Directory

This directory contains images for the studio booking application.

## Important Files:

- `studio-placeholder.jpg` - This is used as a placeholder when studio images fail to load.

## Instructions for the placeholder image:

1. Replace the placeholder file with a real JPG image (recommended size: 300x200px)
2. Ensure the filename remains `studio-placeholder.jpg`
3. The placeholder should be a generic image that represents studios

The placeholder image will be displayed automatically whenever:
- A studio has no images
- A studio's image URL is invalid or cannot be loaded
- Network issues prevent the original image from loading
